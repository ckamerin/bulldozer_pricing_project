# bulldozer_pricing_project
Educational project from Udemy course based on Kaggle project

This project aims to use training and validaiton data to create a price prediction model which is then tested for accurcy on a test data set. Multiple regressors will be tested.

 Predicting the sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning (Time Series Data)

# 1. Problem Definition
 How well can we predict the future sale price of Bulldozers given charactistics and previous data of similar bulldozers.

# 2. Data

 The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for bulldozers.
 All information on the data can be found there.
